# Learning Python for Data Science

This is my project for learning Python for data science. I plan on using a mix of [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/). As I'm already familiar with RStudio, Spyder was the closest thing that mirrored that type of layout and functionality.

## Outline 
I plan on building a self-guided course from a few other resources:
